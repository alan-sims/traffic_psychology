# Traffic Psychology Lab - Code Repository

This repository serves as the central code backup and collaboration hub for all traffic psychology research projects conducted by our lab. We focus on understanding driver behavior, decision-making, and safety across various traffic scenarios.

## 🚗 Current Projects

### Active Research
- **[Close Following Behavior Analysis](projects/close_following/)** - Comprehensive analysis of tailgating behavior across highway vs rural environments and different following roles

- **[Multi-tasking While Driving](projects/multitasking/)** -
